### Self Assessment
Welcome to my portfolio. I am currently at Southern New Hampshire University obtaining a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am aspiring to develop my skills within my current career combining software engineering and information security. Each opportunity and experience I have had has helped strenghten and clarify my future career goals within the Computer Science field. 

I love bowling, playing software, mountain and roading bicyclin, riding motorcycle and spending time with family and friends. I am always up for a adventure wether it is on the motorcycle or enjoying time with my newphews. 

This page will give you a glimpse into who I am and display my projects and experiences that have shaped me.
